# R3ZST

A roguelike game set in a cyberpunk world, where the player must destroy Safety Globalâ€™s data centers by hacking their computer networks.

Developed as an excuse to exercise some interesting programming and gamedev concepts, including (in no particular order):

- ES6-based dependency injection (inspired by Guice)
- Random Number Generators (xorwow)
- Entity-Component System
- Turn-centric game loops
- Event management
- WebGL-based (inc. shaders) character UIs
- Rule/player systems
- Raster font editing and rendering

UNFINISHED, UNPOLISHED, BUT RELEASED. HAVE FUN!
